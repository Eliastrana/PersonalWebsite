## Algorithms and datastructures

#### **CODE:** SCHOOL PROJECT
In a very backend focused semester, finding time to develop frontend projects became difficult. After getting endless amount of help and support from my fellow students throughout the course "Algorithms and datastructures", and never getting a great understanding of the content, the situation pictured occurred. 

Trygve, pictured above, was struggling with his code, and asked for my help. Usually, this benefits no one. In this rare instance, i looked at a while-loop and asked why he formulated his logic in that manner. This line was modified, and the code ran on the first try. With my personal favorite programming language being markdown, this successful change to the code came as a surprise to the entire room. This event, indirectly and unintended, forced me to write my first logic based code since june.      


```java
while (true) {
   work();    
}
