## ClipCutter

#### **WORK:** PERSONAL GROUP IDEA

### The Idea

The idea of ClipCutter is to function as a website that allows a user to upload videos and then split them into chosen time intervals. This is to make it easier to share videos on social media, where there is a limit to how long a video can be. The user can then download the split videos and share them on social media.
