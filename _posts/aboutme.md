## Who am I?

My name is Elias Trana, and I am a student at NTNU Trondheim, studying Computer Engineering.
This is my personal website where I will be posting my project, both personal and school related. I will also be posting my photography work here.

#### **WORK:** INFORMATION

## Software Development

My main focus is on software development. This is my education and will be my line of work after i am finished with my studies. My education focuses on backend development, with a large focus on system development. We also learn crutial concepts like operating systems, algorithms and databases. 

For personal development and learning, I mostly have a frontend focus. This involves mostly development of websites, development using React and React Native, and development of mobile applications. This website was built using Next.js and React.

## Photography

My photography work is mostly a hobby. My work is mostly student focused, whether it be for a student sports organisation, or for the student magazine I am a part of.
