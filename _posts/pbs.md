## Private Budgeting Software

#### **WORK:** TEAM SCHOOL PROJECT
#### **GRADE:** B

### The Task

This was 45% of the grade for the course "Systemutvikling 1". The focus was on working as a team to develop a private budgeting software that a user can utilize to gain a larger control over their own finances. The code is available at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Eliastrana/PBS).
The total work also includes a 160 page report, which is not included in this portfolio. It contains everything from the development process, notes from meetings, the improvements of the code, the strategies used, as well as all the functionality of the software.
