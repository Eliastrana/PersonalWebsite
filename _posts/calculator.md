## FullStack: Calculator

#### **WORK:** SCHOOL


This is a calculator made in Vue. It catches mistakes like dividing by 0, and displays error messages. The calculator has a history that shows previous calculations.

The visual identity of the calculator is created by Frid Ekseth, and the code is written by me.
